# Analyze-A-B-Test
This is a part of Udacity Advanced Data Analysis A/B Test Project 

In this project i made Preprocessing for the data which is a simulation for a new page launch and i wanted to test the results based on the conversion for both the control and treatmenbt groups.

in the project i wanted to make Hypothesis testing and calculate the p-value to decide if we will launch the new page or not
